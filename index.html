    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>High-performance computing (HPC) has revolutionized various fields, from climate modeling to drug discovery and astrophysics. HPC allows researchers to simulate complex phenomena and systems, leading to significant scientific advances.
    However, HPC systems require substantial power and generate large amounts of heat, which can be challenging. Addressing these challenges is critical for the sustainability of HPC systems, both from an environmental and a social justice perspective.</p>
    <p>In this project you'll delve into the intersection of social justice, energy, and power sustainability in HPC. You'll explore the relationship between the location of HPC centers, their energy usage, and their impact on climate change indicators and low-income energy affordability data.</p>
